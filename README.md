# App-sekection-by-hand-gesture

The provided code is a Python script that uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control the opening of various web applications using the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for webcam access. Here's a short description of what the code does:

1. It imports necessary libraries, including OpenCV (`cv2`), MediaPipe (`mediapipe`), and `webbrowser` for web application control.

2. It sets up hand tracking using MediaPipe by configuring the maximum number of hands to detect, the minimum detection confidence, and other parameters.

3. The code captures video frames from the webcam and processes them to detect hand landmarks (positions of hand joints and fingers).

4. It analyzes the hand landmarks to determine the number of fingers extended, by checking the positions of specific finger landmarks (thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky finger).

5. Based on the number of extended fingers, it opens different web applications in a web browser. For example, extending two fingers opens YouTube, three fingers open Google, four fingers open WhatsApp, five fingers open LinkedIn, and one finger opens Spotify. It ensures that each application is opened only once by maintaining boolean flags for each application.

6. If the number of extended fingers changes, it updates the flags to allow reopening the applications when the corresponding gesture is detected again.

7. The processed image with hand landmarks and the detected number of fingers is displayed in a window using OpenCV's `imshow` function.

8. The code continuously runs in a loop until the 'Esc' key (key code 27) is pressed, at which point it releases the webcam and closes the OpenCV windows.

In summary, this code demonstrates a simple hand gesture recognition system that allows the user to control the opening of specific web applications by extending different numbers of fingers.
